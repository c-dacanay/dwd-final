# Final Proposal

### The Path of Least Resistance

Something I'd like to do is round out the Community Crayola project by implimenting a color palette component where users can store the colors they encounter and possibly download the palettes/hex codes they create and rename. Potentially storing the palettes? A new page where you can look at the palettes that people have created? Seems totally reasonable!

### The Path of Considerably More Resistance

The other, start-from-scratch idea that I am playing with is the idea of creating a website/visual novel/game(?) about a childhood bedroom. I'm inspired by [Emily Carrol's comic (cw: spooky)](http://emcarroll.com/comics/margot/index.html) and am thinking of four primary web pages:

1. Stare out the window
   ... This would have a web page would have an animated scene (possibly a [p5js sketch similar to this one](https://editor.p5js.org/cdacanay/full/rrRFuvb2)) with some music in the background.
2. Write in your diary
   ... Write and read diary entries from a database. I would provide the first entries on my own.
3. Look around your bookshelf
   ... Some fun div layouts that connects to a quote API
4. Lay in bed
   ... Some calming, [meditative web art](http://www.returnreverse.com/)?

This synthesizes everything we've learned in DWD in a way that I enjoy; I'm excited about the storytelling possibilities! But is it crazy to do all this designing, wire framing and building in 2 weeks? One week wherin I will be in Hawaii with my family?

### Feedback?

I'd love to have your thoughts on what you think might be more worthwhile, or any conceptual critiques you might have~! In thinking about Community Crayola I actually thought of a few more ways to complicate the project so I think it might be more of a satisfying challenge, but my heart wants the harder project.

Lastly, thanks for this class! I know it's been a struggle for you and Joey as much as us, but you've handled it all with grace. Looking back it's really incredible how much I learned in 7 weeks. Your efforts in class, the guides, and in-person are really noticed and appreciated.
